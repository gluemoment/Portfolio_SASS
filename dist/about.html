        <p>I had an idea one day to build a start up lol... Duhhh, why did I not just hire somebody to do all the coding and become a billionare that easy? But... I obviosly decided to do it all myself and I think I still made the right choice;) </p>

      <div class="job job-1">
        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <h6>Front End Development</h6>
        <p>HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap 4: and even though many think that these cornerstone basics are easy... well, i didn't personaly find them easy at all. A lot of knowledge is needed to be able to put everything into front end to get really nice good looking websites, moreover, working across many browsers, devices and according to one's preferences.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="job job-2">
        <h3>Back End Developer</h3>
        <h6>Back End Technologies</h6>
        <p>A little of Python to make Front End do some extra-extra stuff, Django? A little bit of JavaScript and JQuery to make it all look good at the end... A little bit of Swift to make an IOS Apps? n A little bit of hardcore Scala to be able to understand statically-typed languages and to use Spark? Phew, along with (what was it called) Ubuntu? and Linux (*Facepalm)? and also to be able to deploy stuff on Digital Ocean and Heroku and (sorry lol) Netlify, just kidding, Docker? OMG, do I have to include MERN here too (even though React is not really Back End)? and can I just stop here now then before I just blow up myself here?</p>
      </div>

      <div class="job job-3">
        <h3>Data Science & even SEO</h3>
        <h6>Next Level to Full stack With a Twist</h6>
        <p>Gosh... where do I even start here? Pandas, ScikitLearn and Seaborn? Keras, Cost function, Cross validation with Confusion Matrix? Or Should I just include Actiovation functions here or Gradient descent and Optimizers too? or Maybe just start with Linear Algebra, Calculus and Dataframes as well as all kinds of Data Manipulation using Python or R prior to all that? I think I'd rather just stop here now and just tell you that XGBoost is not a vacuum cleaner model btw. Nuff!
        P.S. oh I did some GoogleAds for my partner when setting up her business to haha, collected data afterwards and doing some Data Science to make it more efficient now </p>
